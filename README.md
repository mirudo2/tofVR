# Starting TowerOfFantasy with UEVR:
The following tutorial has only been tested in the global version.

1. Download the [UEVR](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR/releases) mod if you don't have it.

2. Download this [tofVR-main.zip](https://github.com/mirudo2/tofVR/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

3. Copy the "TowerOfFantasyVR" folder to: "C:\" ("C:\TowerOfFantasyVR").

4. Copy the two UEVR mod dlls: (UEVRBackend.dll and openxr_loader.dll), to the folder: "C:\TowerOfFantasyVR".

# Running

Before launching "loader.exe", make sure your SteamVR is set to OpenXR runtime.

If not, click the button to set SteamVR as the OpenXR runtime(Mandatory for it to work!).

Once all this is done, start "loader.exe" as administrator, and then start the game

When the world is already loaded, press "**CTRL + O**" to load VR mode.
